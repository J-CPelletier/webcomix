## Usage

`webcomix [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]`

### Global Flags

#### help

Show the help message and exit.

#### Version

Show the version number and exit.

### Commands

#### comics

Shows all predefined comics which can be used with the `download` command.

#### download

Downloads a predefined comic. Supports the `--cbz` flag, which creates a .cbz archive of the downloaded comic.

#### search

Searches for an XPath that can download the whole comic. Supports the `--cbz` flag, which creates a .cbz archive of the downloaded comic,`-s`, which verifies only the provided page of the comic, `-y`, which skips the verification prompt, and `-j`, which runs the javascript on pages before downloading.

#### custom

Downloads a user-defined comic. To download a specific comic, you'll need a link to the first page, an XPath expression giving out the link to the next page and an XPath expression giving out the link to the image. More info [here](http://www.w3schools.com/xml/xpath_syntax.asp). Supports the `--cbz` flag, which creates a .cbz archive of the downloaded comic, `-s`, which verifies only the provided page of the comic, and `-y`, which skips the verification prompt.

### Examples

* `webcomix download xkcd`
* `webcomix search xkcd --start-url=http://xkcd.com/1/`
* `webcomix custom --cbz` (You will be prompted about other needed arguments)
* `webcomix custom xkcd --start-url=http://xkcd.com/1/ --next-page-xpath="//a[@rel='next']/@href" --image-xpath="//div[@id='comic']//img/@src" --cbz` (Same as before, but with all arguments declared beforehand)

### Making an XPath selector

Using an HTML inspector, spot a html path to the next link's `href` attribute/comic image's `src` attribute.

e.g.: `//div[@class='foo']/img/@src`
This will select the src attribute of the first image whose class is: foo

Note: `webcomix` works best on static websites, since `scrapy`(the framework we use to travel web pages) doesn't process Javascript.

To make sure your XPath is correct, you have to go into `scrapy shell`, which should be downloaded when you've installed `webcomix`.

```
scrapy shell <website> --> Use the website's url to go to it.
> response.body --> Will give you the html from the website.
> response.xpath --> Test an xpath selection. If you get [], this means your XPath expression hasn't gotten anything from the webpage.
```

## Contribution

The procedure depends on the type of contribution:

* If you simply want to request the addition of a comic to the list of supported comics, make an issue with the label "Enhancement".
* If you want to request the addition of a feature to the system or a bug fix, make an issue with the appropriate label.

### Running the tests

To run the tests, you have to use the `pytest` command in the webcomix folder.
